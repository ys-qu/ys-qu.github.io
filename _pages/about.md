Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi there! Welcome to my personal website! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering (Transportation) at Purdue University - West Lafayette, advised by Prof. Samuel Labi and co-advised by  Prof. Sikai Chen (UW-Madison).

My research centers on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in transportation and Intelligent Autonomous Systems, with a particular focus on autonomous driving, human-in-the-loop AI, human-robot interaction, reinforcement learning, multimodal large language models, transfer learning, spatiotemporal data mining, and traffic safety. My work strives to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications.
