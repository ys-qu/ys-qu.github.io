Hi there! Welcome to my personal website! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering (Transportation) at Purdue University - West Lafayette, advised by Prof. Samuel Labi and co-advised by  Prof. Sikai Chen (UW-Madison).

My research centers on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in transportation and Intelligent Autonomous Systems, with a particular focus on autonomous driving, human-in-the-loop AI, human-robot interaction, reinforcement learning, multimodal large language models, transfer learning, spatiotemporal data mining, and traffic safety. My work strives to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications.
