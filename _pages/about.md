Hi there! Welcome to my personal website! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering (Transportation) at Purdue University - West Lafayette, advised by [Prof. Samuel Labi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=2416) at the [Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT), Purdue]([https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=2416](https://ccat.umtri.umich.edu/?_ga=2.3994608.1136169267.1672760509-568050463.1668408267)) and co-advised by [Prof. Sikai Chen](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/cee/Faculty/Chen_Sikai/) at [Sky-Lab](https://sky-lab-uw.github.io/).

My research centers on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in transportation and Intelligent Autonomous Systems, with a particular focus on autonomous driving, human-in-the-loop AI, human-robot interaction, reinforcement learning, multimodal large language models, transfer learning, spatiotemporal data mining, and traffic safety. My work strives to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications.
